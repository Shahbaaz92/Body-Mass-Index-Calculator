          <p>
            Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our
            body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole
            determinant of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point
            to evaluate your overall health and well-being.

          <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
          <p>
            A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
            Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing
            health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for
            a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating
            ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
            physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a
            week.

          <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
          <p>
            Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is
            not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully
            consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement
            may not be beneficial to use.

            <img src="assets/images/icon-gender.svg" />
            <h4>Gender</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with
            age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when
            evaluating their BMI.

        <article class="limit limit-age">
          <div class="limit-logo">
            <img src="assets/images/icon-age.svg" />
            <h4>Age</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause
            BMI to underestimate body fat content.

            <h4>Muscle</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as
            it doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.

            <h4>Pregnancy</h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby.
            Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise
            health risks for both mother and child.

            Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and
            Asian origins at lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is
            advised to discuss this with your GP or practice nurse.
